# Sepsis Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
This project aims to predict sepsis before conventional detection methods using machine learning and deep learning approaches.

# Overview
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires early detection for effective treatment. This project aims to predict sepsis using machine learning (Gradient Boosting) and deep learning (Neural Networks) models.
The models aim to provide early detection of sepsis by analyzing clinical parameters, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.

# Dataset
* The dataset consists of patient records with medical parameters.
* It includes vital signs, lab results, and other features relevant to sepsis detection.
* Preprocessing steps handle missing values and normalize the data for model training.

# Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing

* Handling missing values using SimpleImputer
* Feature scaling with StandardScaler
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights
* Feature selection for optimal model performance

2.Model Training & Evaluation

* Gradient Boosting Classifier:

Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that builds multiple weak learners (typically decision trees) and combines them sequentially to improve predictive performance. It minimizes errors by learning from the mistakes of previous trees, resulting in a highly accurate model.

Why Use Gradient Boosting for Sepsis Prediction?
* It handles imbalanced data well, which is crucial since sepsis cases are rare compared to non-sepsis cases.
* Feature importance analysis allows us to identify the most critical clinical parameters for early detection.
* It reduces overfitting by using techniques like learning rate tuning and early stopping.

Evaluation Metrics for Gradient Boosting
* ROC-AUC Score: Measures the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between septic and non-septic patients.
* Confusion Matrix: Evaluates False Positives and False Negatives, crucial for medical diagnoses.

* Neural Network Model:

Neural Networks are deep learning models inspired by the human brain. They are especially useful for complex pattern recognition and can uncover deep relationships within the data that traditional models might miss.

Why Use Neural Networks for Sepsis Prediction?
* They can detect non-linear relationships in patient data that traditional models struggle with.
* Adaptive learning ensures the model improves with more data.
* Deep feature extraction allows it to find hidden patterns that might indicate early-stage sepsis.

Evaluation Metrics for Neural Network Model
* ROC-AUC Curve: To compare with Gradient Boosting and assess model reliability.
