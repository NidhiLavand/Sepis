# Sepsis Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
This project aims to predict sepsis before conventional detection methods using machine learning and deep learning approaches.

#Overview
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that requires early detection for effective treatment. This project aims to predict sepsis using machine learning (Gradient Boosting) and deep learning (Neural Networks) models.
The models aim to provide early detection of sepsis by analyzing clinical parameters, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.

#Dataset
*The dataset consists of patient records with medical parameters.
*It includes vital signs, lab results, and other features relevant to sepsis detection.
*Preprocessing steps handle missing values and normalize the data for model training.
